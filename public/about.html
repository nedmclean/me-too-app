<p> The majority of women in the U.S. have faced some form of sexual harassment at work.  We are part of a coding team which reflects the kind of intersectionality key to the struggles for social justice in our country today.  Mindful of rampant sexual abuse and harassment within our industry, we want to provide technical tools for social change.  We've developed the #MeToo app in support of the Me Too initiative of Tarana Burke and the organization which she founded in 2007, and the recent waves of #Me Too pronouncements in 2017 which help propel the movement forward.  
</p>
<p>
The purpose of the #MeToo app is to make immediate recognition and affirmation possible through button-click access to forums and helpful resources for women who feel alone while they experience sexual harassment and abuse and in our ongoing struggless to resist, heal and empower ourselves and our children.

<p>On its cover, Time called the people behind the movement “The Silence Breakers.”  Its’ story features women and men who have spoken out — including activist Tarana Burke, who started the hashtag 10 years ago.

Time magazine says the women who shared stories about sexual harassment and abuse through the #MeToo campaign — the “silence breakers” — are its Person of the Year.
</p>
<p>
#MeToo rose to prominence as a social media campaign in the wake of high-profile accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.  After actress Alyssa Milano popularized the hashtag, thousands of women began sharing their stories about the pervasive damage wrought by sexual harrassment.
